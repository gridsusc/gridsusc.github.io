## GRIDS Tutorials

GRIDS Tutorials is a collaborative effort to create a collection of tutorials for all things Data Science and Computer Science. Our goal is to create a wiki of tutorials by USC Students, for USC Students to aid students of all levels across various topics. We will have incentives for our contributors and your profile will be featured on the GRIDS platform. If you are someone who has experience in any of the following (or if you have your own ideas) and would like to author or contribute code for a tutorial, please sign up! Here are some example topics:

- Introduction to Programming (Python, R)
- Python Packages
- Machine Learning
- Deep Learning frameworks
- Installing tools and technologies (for Windows and Mac)
- Object Oriented Programming
- Web Scraping
- Data Exploration
- Data Visualization
- Database Management
- Web Development
- Game Development
- Data processing frameworks
- C/C++
- JAVA

Please note that you are not expected to write a full, comprehensive tutorial all by yourself! The aim is to collaborate together (similar to Wikipedia) and build a collection of knowledge over time.
