Social media platforms have lately become the primary means of communication and source of news for billions of people around the world. This growth in activity on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Reddit, has made them rich sources of data for understanding how people interact with and are influenced by information online. Given the importance of computational methods in analyzing this data, we were very excited to host a talk by Ashok Deb, a USC CS PhD student and currently-serving, Active-duty Army officer, on the topic of mining social media and using Twitter for research purposes. Ashok has extensive experience of working with social media data in applications areas ranging from political elections and cyber security to social consumerism and health behaviors, and shared with us his experience, insights, and advice on analyzing sociopolitical campaigns on Twitter and the challenges it holds.
