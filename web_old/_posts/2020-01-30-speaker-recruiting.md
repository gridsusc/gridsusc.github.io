With career fairs right around the corner, our first talk for Spring 2020 was a timely one on the topic of technical recruiting. [Emily Chen](http://echen102.github.io/), a current USC CS PhD student and former software engineer at Cisco Systems (where was part of the campus team as a technical recruiter and interviewer for 3 recruiting seasons at top schools), shared her experience, insights, and advice for those navigating this process right now or planning to do so in the future.

Thank you for sharing your knowledge, Emily!
