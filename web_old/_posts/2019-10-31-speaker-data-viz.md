GRIDS members had a very spooky treat on Halloween as Romi Alsaid, a Computer Science master's student at USC, presented on the topic of Data Visualization. She took us through topics such as information visualization, visualization design, and the tools used in this broad field, as well as answer our questions at the end. You really know your stuff, Romi, and we appreciate you sharing your knowledge with us.
