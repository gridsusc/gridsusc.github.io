GRIDS's fearless leader [Samar Haider](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samarhaider "Samar Haider LinkedIn") led us on a journey through Deep Learning with Python, starting from the basics of machine learning and deep learning all the way to today's applications of the technology as well as how anyone can get started using freely available tools. Thank you for sharing your knowledge and experience with us, Samar!
