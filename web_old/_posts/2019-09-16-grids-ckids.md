At our Fall 2019 Kickoff meeting we announced that GRIDS was trying something different this year - namely, we would be partnering with the USC Center for Knowledge-Powered Interdisciplinary Data Science ([CKIDS](https://sites.usc.edu/ckids/ "CKIDS")), headed by Dr. Yolanda Gil, to work on faculty-led projects ranging from studying video game communities to Catalina Island coastlines. GRIDSters excitedly listened to project descriptions delivered by USC researchers and signed up for the ones that interested them most. These projects, along with our traditional student-led projects, will make this our best semester yet!
