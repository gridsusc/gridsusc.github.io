For our first industry event of the year, members of the Data & Analytics team from [Slalom Consulting](https://www.slalom.com) LA gave a talk on Data Science in Consulting. They described their philosophy and approach to data science/machine learning projects, took us through some real-world client projects, and gave a demo on Amazon Sagemaker. It was a fun and valuable experience for everyone that attended. Thank you, Slalom!
