Our second data science talk of the semester was from [Mozhdeh Gheini](http://www-scf.usc.edu/~gheini/ "Mozhdeh Gheini home page"), first-semester Ph.D. student working with Professor Jonathan May at the [USC Information Sciences Institute](https://isi.edu/ "USC ISI home page"). She presented on the topic of "What You Need to Know to get Started with NLP", the area she focuses in. Thank you for the great evening, Mozhdeh!
