For our first data science talk of Fall 2019, we had the pleasure of hosting [Thamme "TG" Gowda](https://isi.edu/~tg/ "TG home page") on the topic of Best Practices for Research Reproducibility Using Python. TG, a Computer Science Ph. D. student at Viterbi and research programmer at [USC Information Sciences Institute](https://isi.edu/ "USC ISI") (ISI), took us through the why's, the what's, and the how's of creating elegant, reusable, and reproducible code. We really appreciate you sharing your vast knowledge, TG!
