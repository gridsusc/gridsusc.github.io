GRIDS partnered with the International Data Engineering and Science Association (IDEAS) again this fall and had 40+ members sign up to attend the [conference](https://www.ideassn.org/socal-2019/ "IDEAS Conference"). We enjoyed a full day of sessions in tracks like AI, Big Data, and FinTech at the Los Angeles Convention Center, just a hop, skip, and jump away from USC. We look forward to continuing this partnership through the years!
