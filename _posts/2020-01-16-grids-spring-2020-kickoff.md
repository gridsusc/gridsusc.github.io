What a way to to start the new semester! Thank you to everyone who attended our kickoff event for the Spring 2020 semester. We had 20 projects pitched by faculty members from across different schools at USC to an equally diverse audience of over 150 students. We're very excited about all the project ideas and can't wait to see the work all of you do in them over the course of this semester!
