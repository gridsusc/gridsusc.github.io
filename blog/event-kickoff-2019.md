Thank you to everyone who made it out to the CKIDS/GRIDS Fall 2019 Project Presentations. We are especially proud of all the great work the teams put in on their projects and accompanying presentations and posters! The event was attended by numerous students and faculty from different schools at USC, all of whom were highly impressed by the quality of work they saw.
