Our second data science talk of the semester was from [Mozhdeh Gheini](http://www-scf.usc.edu/~gheini/), first-semester Ph.D. student working with Professor Jonathan May at the [USC Information Sciences Institute](https://isi.edu/). She presented on the topic of “What You Need to Know to get Started with NLP”, the area she focuses in. Thank you for the great evening, Mozhdeh!
