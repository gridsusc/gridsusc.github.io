This workshop was led by Mrs Ann John. The workshop explored the intersection of data science and the US Space Force, with a particular focus on the safety group at the SSC division. The workshop began with an overview of the US Space Force and its mission to protect US interests in space. It then moved on to explore how data science is being used to improve safety and efficiency in space operations.

The workshop then delved into the specific work being done by the safety group at the SSC division. Participants learned about how the safety group is using data science to identify potential hazards and risks in space operations, and to develop strategies to mitigate those risks. They also learned about the various data science tools and techniques that are being used by the safety group, such as machine learning, statistical analysis, and data visualization.

Overall, the workshop provided a fascinating glimpse into the cutting-edge work being done by the US Space Force and the role that data science is playing in ensuring the safety and success of space operations.
