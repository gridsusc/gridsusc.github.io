During the workshop, participants were encouraged to reflect on their own experiences and skills and
to brainstorm ways to showcase them in their resumes. They were asked to complete exercises or activities
to help them identify their strengths and accomplishments and to develop language to describe them in
their resumes.

The facilitators provided feedback on participants' resumes, pointing out areas where they can improve
and offering suggestions for how to highlight their strengths and experience more effectively.
Participants were typically given time to work on their resumes during the workshop, and the facilitators
were available to answer questions and provide additional guidance as needed.

At the end of the workshop, participants had a better understanding of how to create a professional and
effective resume that highlights their skills and experience. They were also equipped with the tools and
knowledge to continue refining their resumes and adapt them to different job opportunities in the future.
