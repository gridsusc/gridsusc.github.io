With career fairs right around the corner, our first talk for Spring 2020 was a timely one on the topic of technical recruiting. [Emily Chen](http://echen102.github.io/), a current USC CS PhD student and former software engineer at Cisco Systems (where was part of the campus team as a technical recruiter and interviewer for 3 recruiting seasons at top schools), shared her experience, insights, and advice for those navigating this process right now or planning to do so in the future.
