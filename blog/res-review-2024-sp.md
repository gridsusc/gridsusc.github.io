Per tradition, the Graduates Rising in Information and Data Science (GRIDS) association at USC hosted the Resume Review event on March 22, 2024. The event focuses on helping students boost their resumes and contribute to their full-time / internship hunt.

The purpose is getting resumes reviewed by industry individuals with experience in SDE/DS roles, giving a more realistic and holistic overview of the market demands.

The event was made even better with the addition of pizza and soft drinks, which everyone enjoyed while playing the game. It provided a relaxed and comfortable atmosphere for everyone to enjoy each other's company and the games.

The list of reviewers ranged from companies like Apple, Meta to reviewers from our own campus to ensure quality tips and tricks to aid students. During the 2-hour long workshop, many students showed up with their resumes to seek professional help. Halfway through the event, there was a brief presentation to make everyone well versed with GRIDS motives and contributors for the year 2024 where the team leads introduced themselves. 

There were drinks for everyone present and post a small intermission, the event continued where the reviewers and reviewee amalgamated their individual thoughts and brainstormed on how to bring together the skills and experiences of the reviewee resulting in a resume with top, crisp details.

As the event came to an end, participants now had a more put together thought of how to outshine their resume and a better understanding of where exactly their resumes lacked. They were also equipped with the tools and knowledge to continue refining their resumes further and prepare them well to stand as competition for different job opportunities in the future.
