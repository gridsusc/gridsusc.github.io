GRIDS recorded an enlightening workshop on Gen AI in studio, tailored for USC students intrigued by the intersection of artificial intelligence and genetics. The talk provides the audience with a captivating exploration into the fascinating world of Gen AI.

Due to difficulties with our venue and active disruptions on campus, the session was recorded at home, and published here.
