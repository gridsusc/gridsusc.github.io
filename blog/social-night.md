The Social night was a fun and exciting event for everyone! It was an opportunity to meet new people, socialize with other people interested in data science, and play a game of 4 pictures one word. The game is a fun and engaging way to test one's creativity and vocabulary skills by guessing the word that is common to all four pictures.

The event was made even better with the addition of pizza and soft drinks, which everyone enjoyed while playing the game. It provided a relaxed and comfortable atmosphere for everyone to enjoy each other's company and the games.
