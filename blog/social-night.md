The Social night was a fun and exciting event for everyone! It was an opportunity to meet new people, socialize with other people interested in data science, and play a game of 4 pictures one word. The game is a fun and engaging way to test one's creativity and vocabulary skills by guessing the word that is common to all four pictures.
